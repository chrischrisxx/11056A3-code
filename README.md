Project Reflection: 

In this web design project, I have further understood the concepts of web page structure, visual communication, and user experience design through practice. The whole website revolves around Gordon Andrews' modernist design concept. I try to reflect his style in layout, color selection, font application,  and make the interface as intuitive and straightforward as possible to enhance the comfort of the user browsing. I pay special attention to the logical clarity of navigation to ensure visitors can easily find the information they need, which performs well in the desktop test. I also implemented a function that displays related text when the mouse hovers over the picture. This design enhances the interactivity of the page and improves the efficiency of information transmission. Users can get more background content or work descriptions while browsing without clicking on the picture, reducing the operation steps and improving the fluency of the user experience.

However, during the project, I also realized that I still have many shortcomings in responsive design, especially in the immaturity of breakpoint processing. Although I set some basic CSS media queries for the website to make it adaptable to laptops and mobile phones, there are still many problems in the specific implementation. For example, some images and texts fail to scale proportionally on small screens, and the spacing of individual modules is not reasonable enough. These problems affect the website's overall visual effect and readability on mobile devices.

Modern web design must consider multi-device compatibility, and it is far from enough to focus only on the desktop. In order to improve the professionalism and user experience of the website, I need to further systematically learn the design principles of responsive layout, such as flexible grid systems, more sophisticated breakpoint settings.

Through this project, I exercised my practical skills in HTML and CSS and learned how to transform design concepts into specific interfaces. More importantly, this process made me realize the importance of project testing and user experience evaluation. In future design practice, I will take this experience on breakpoint as a key improvement direction and continuously improve my ability in front-end development and cross-device interface optimization.



Prototypes - Design Intentions and Implementation:

Most of my core page structures and design styles were successfully implemented during the development process according to the high-fidelity prototype, including the homepage layout and responsive navigation bar.

In the actual development, I also adjusted and optimized some functions. For example, the text of the "Works" page in the prototype was originally located below the image, but this presentation was confusing overall, and the text was difficult to recognize. To solve this problem, I changed it to an interactive effect that displays text when the mouse hovers to more clearly achieve the combination of pictures and text. In addition, the website's color scheme and style are consistent with the prototype to ensure the unity of the design language.

However, some design ideas were not realized. I originally planned to add more swiping personal portrait images of Gordon Andrews to the homepage. Although this idea was not presented in the prototype, I considered adding it in the later development. Due to time constraints and the high complexity of the front-end implementation, this function was not completed.

Through the prototype design and development comparison process, I have gained a deeper understanding of the need to balance design concepts and technical implementations. I also learned how to make reasonable trade-offs within a limited time and capabilities.

Provides clear HTML and CSS tutorials with code examples, which I often refer to when unsure about the syntax, especially regarding page structure and basic styling.

Figma – https://www.figma.com

I use it to create prototypes, plan the website's layout and interface visual style in advance, and confirm the overall design direction before development.

Google Fonts – https://fonts.google.com

I picked fonts that fit the Gordon Andrews design style and ensured they were friendly and consistent across the site.
