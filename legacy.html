      <p class="title">Designing the first decimal banknotes</p>
      <p>In 1963 Andrews was invited to submit designs for Australia's new decimal currency
        banknotes, along with fellow designers Richard Beck, Max Forbes and George Hamori. The
        selection committee, headed by Russell Drysdale, voted unanimously for Andrews' designs,
        and on 14 February, 1966, Australia's new decimal $1, $2, $10 and $20 banknotes entered
        circulation. His designs were bold and each banknote captured a unique aspect of Australian
        life.</p>
      <p>Andrews was subsequently engaged to design the $5 banknote, issued in 1967, and later
        the $50 banknote, issued in 1973. When polymer notes began to replace paper ones,
        Andrews served on the advisory panel that oversaw their design. Shortly after Andrews'
        death in 2001 his friend Alan James noted, 'I know of no other currency that captures the
        rugged vibrancy and spirit of a place the way ours does. To his continuing credit, the new
        polymer notes reflect the spirit of the work he did'.</p>
